## About The Project

* "PEEK-A-BOO" was a captivating memory matching game that I created to challenge players' memory and observation skills. The game presented players with a grid containing hidden pairs of integers, initially concealed behind 'X' symbols. The goal was to uncover these hidden pairs with as few guesses as possible.

* The game showcases a grid with columns labeled using letters (e.g., A, B, C) and rows labeled with numbers (e.g., 0, 1, 2). Each cell within the grid was uniquely identified by a letter/number combination (e.g., A0, B2).

* Upon starting the game, all grid cells were covered with 'X' symbols, concealing the numbers. Players relied on their memory and deductive reasoning to match pairs of hidden numbers.

* A straightforward menu interface that empowers players to interact with the game seamlessly, providing options for making guesses and navigating through the gameplay.

* Implemented a scoring mechanism that tracks the number of guesses taken by the player compared to the minimum number required for each grid size. This scoring system added depth to the game, encouraging players to optimize their memory skills.
  
* Ensured the game keeps running, providing players with an immersive and seamless experience in the command prompt. This uninterrupted gameplay enhances user engagement.
